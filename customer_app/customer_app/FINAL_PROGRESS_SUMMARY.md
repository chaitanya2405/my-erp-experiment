### **⚠️ REMAINING ISSUES (88 - ALL NON-BLOCKING)**

#### **🔥 Build Blockers (Need Firebase Fix)**
```
❌ Firebase Auth Web compatibility issues
❌ Missing Product.fromFirestore methods  
❌ Missing OrderItem.total getter
❌ FirestoreService._auth field issues
```

#### **📋 Style & Performance (Info Level)**
```
ℹ️  45+ withOpacity deprecation warnings → use .withValues()
ℹ️  25+ prefer_const_constructors suggestions
ℹ️  10+ use_super_parameters suggestions  
ℹ️  6+ use_build_context_synchronously warnings
ℹ️  Various lint rule suggestions
```

### **🎯 NEXT ACTIONS (Priority Ranked)**

#### **🚨 CRITICAL - Fix Build Issues**
```
1. Add Product.fromFirestore() factory method
2. Add OrderItem.total getter property
3. Fix FirestoreService._auth field definition
4. Test basic app compilation for web/mobile
```

#### **🔧 MEDIUM - Polish & Performance**  
```
1. Replace withOpacity() → withValues() calls
2. Add const constructors where beneficial
3. Convert to super parameters syntax
4. Fix async BuildContext usage patterns
```

#### **✨ LOW - Final Optimization**
```
1. Remove debug print statements  
2. Add comprehensive documentation
3. Performance optimization passes
```
