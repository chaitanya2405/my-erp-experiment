    // Your data logic here
    return data;
  },
);

// 2. Request data from ANY module
final products = await BridgeHelper.getData(
  'inventory_management', 
  'products',
  filters: {'store_id': 'store123'},
);

// 3. Send events to trigger workflows
await BridgeHelper.sendEvent(
  'sale_completed',
  {'amount': 150.0, 'customer_id': 'cust456'},
